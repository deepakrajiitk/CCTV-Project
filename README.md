## Introduction

This repository contains a highly configurable two-stage-tracker that adjusts to different deployment scenarios. The detections generated by [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, are passed to [StrongSORT](https://github.com/dyhBUPT/StrongSORT)[](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13514.pdf) which combines motion and appearance information based on [OSNet](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid)[](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00953) in order to tracks the objects. It can track any object that your Yolov5 model was trained to detect.
